<h1># Stuff that Sucks<span class="date"> on Saturday October 16th, 2021</span></h1>
<h2>## Operating Systems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows">Windows</a> - Windows is a half-coded, non POSIX compliant, closed-source, paid piece of spyware. It's bloated, uses backslashes in paths, forces you to update, and completely uncustomisable (please don't talk to me about aCcEnT cOlOrS). Like, WHY DO PEOPLE STILL USE WINDOWS?!?!
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>## Programming Languages</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> - Java is super repetitive and verbose, forces object-orientation, doesn't handle unsigned numbers correctly, and has a spaghetti implementation of floating-point arithmetic. Did I mention it's super repetitive and verbose?
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>## Big Companies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> - Google is a money-driven monopoly that doesn't understand the meaning of the word 'privacy'. They know everything about you because everything you use is made by them. Google knows who you are, where you live, what you like and what you dislike....  
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>## Chess Stuff</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a> - Chess.com is a paid, buggy, slow chess server. The site is only interested in making money, not with making the best chess site. All critisism of the site or mention of competing sites is removed. Free users are bombarded with ads, leaving you no other option but to upgrade to premium or switch to Lichess (I recommend switching to Lichess).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/">Chessbase</a> - Chessbase is bad. That's it. Wanna know why? BECAUSE THEY STOLE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE (Stockfish, licensed under GPLv2 ) AND SOLD IT CLAIMING IT WAS THEIRS! (Houdini 6 and Fat Fritz 2) Thankfully, the Stockfish team filed a lawsuit against them (I hope they win) <a href="https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2021/our-lawsuit-against-chessbase/">https://stockfishchess.org/blog/2021/our-lawsuit-against-chessbase/</a>
